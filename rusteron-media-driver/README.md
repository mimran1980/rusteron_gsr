# rusteron-media-driver

**rusteron-media-driver** is a Rust interface to the Aeron Media Driver, responsible for managing low-latency messaging infrastructure between producers and consumers. It's part of the [Rusteron](https://github.com/gsrxyz/rusteron) project and provides both standalone and embedded driver support.

> For production deployments, we recommend using the Aeron **Java** or **C** media driver.  
> The embedded version provided here is best suited for integration tests or lightweight environments.

## Usage Examples

<details>
<summary>Standard Media Driver</summary>

```rust
// Launches a standalone Aeron Media Driver
use rusteron_media_driver::*;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let aeron_context = AeronDriverContext::new()?;
    aeron_context.set_dir(c"target/test")?;

    let aeron_driver = AeronDriver::new(&aeron_context)?;
    aeron_driver.start(false)?;
    println!("Aeron Media Driver started");

    Ok(())
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Embedded Media Driver</summary>

```rust
// Embeds the media driver directly into the current process
use rusteron_media_driver::*;
use std::sync::{Arc, atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering}};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let media_driver_ctx = AeronDriverContext::new()?;
    let (stop, driver_handle) = AeronDriver::launch_embedded(media_driver_ctx.clone(), false);

    let ctx = AeronContext::new()?;
    ctx.set_dir(&cformat!("{}", media_driver_ctx.get_dir()))?;

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(3)); // Simulated workload

    stop.store(true, Ordering::SeqCst);
    driver_handle.join().expect("Failed to join driver thread");
    println!("Embedded Aeron Media Driver stopped");

    Ok(())
}
```

</details>

## Building C against Aeron's headers

The crate declares `links = "aeron_driver"`, so a dependent's build script can compile C
(a custom UDP transport, say) against the vendored Aeron sources:

| Variable | Directory |
|---|---|
| `DEP_AERON_DRIVER_INCLUDE` | the media driver's headers |
| `DEP_AERON_DRIVER_CLIENT_INCLUDE` | the client headers they include |
| `DEP_AERON_DRIVER_AERON_ROOT` | the Aeron source tree |
