**rusteron** is a Rust client wrapper for the Aeron C API, designed to help Rust developers interact with Aeron, a high-performance messaging system. This library is built as an extension to the Aeron C bindings, making it easier to leverage Aeron's low-latency communication capabilities in Rust applications.

> **Note**: For an idiomatic Rust API for Aeron, consider using [`aeron-rs`](https://github.com/UnitedTraders/aeron-rs) instead, as this library is still in an alpha phase.

## Project Background

This project is based on a fork of [`libaeron-sys`](https://github.com/bspeice/libaeron-sys). Since it uses C bindings, **rusteron** inherently operates in an `unsafe` context. This means it requires extra caution when using, as incorrect handling can lead to undefined behaviour such as segmentation faults. For example, using a publisher after the `Aeron` client has closed will result in a segmentation fault.

The purpose of **rusteron** is to take these C bindings and generate a Rust wrapper around them to facilitate more ergonomic and performant use in Rust-based applications. Although this is not yet fully idiomatic, it provides a working bridge to the Aeron C API.

The modules in **rusteron** aim to replicate and extend the capabilities available in the Aeron ecosystem, while simplifying their use for developers accustomed to Rust.

## Project Status

**rusteron** is currently in alpha, meaning:

- It is still under active development.
- APIs may be subject to breaking changes.
- It is not recommended for production use at this time.

Community feedback and contributions are welcome to improve its functionality and usability.

## Modules Overview

The library is divided into several modules, each focusing on specific parts of Aeron's functionality:

- **rusteron-code-gen**: This module is responsible for generating the Rust wrapper from the raw C bindings. It helps maintain a clean and repeatable way to bridge between the two languages.

- **rusteron-client**: Provides core client functionalities for interacting with the Aeron protocol, such as establishing connections, subscribing, and publishing. It uses the Aeron C bindings from aeron-client module.

- **rusterion-archive**: Extends the Aeron client to include archiving features, such as recording streams and handling replay capabilities. It uses the Aeron C bindings from aeron-archive module.

- **rusteron-media-driver**: Implements the Aeron Media Driver, a core component for managing messaging between producers and consumers. It uses the Aeron C bindings from aeron-driver module.

## Installation

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` to include the specific **rusteron** module you need in your project. Depending on your use case, you can choose from the following modules:

- **rusteron-client**: For core Aeron client functionalities.
- **rusteron-archive**: For Aeron client with archive capabilities.
- **rusteron-media-driver**: For the Aeron media driver.

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = "0.1"
```

Replace `rusteron-client` with `rusteron-archive` or `rusteron-media-driver` as per your requirement.

## Usage Example

### Aeron Client Example

Below is a step-by-step example of creating and using an Aeron client.

```rust ,no_run
use rusteron::client::{Aeron, AeronContext};
use rusteron_media_driver::AeronDriverContext;
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // start embedded media driver to testing
    let media_driver_ctx = AeronDriverContext::new()?;
    let (stop, driver_handle) = AeronDriver::launch_embedded(media_driver_ctx.clone(), false);

    let ctx = AeronContext::new()?;
    ctx.set_dir(media_driver_ctx.get_dir())?;
    let aeron = Aeron::new(ctx)?;
    aeron.start()?;

    let subscription = aeron
        .async_add_subscription("aeron:ipc", 123,                
                                Handlers::no_available_image_handler(),
                                Handlers::no_unavailable_image_handler())?
        .poll_blocking(Duration::from_secs(5))?;

    let publisher = aeron
        .async_add_publication("aeron:ipc", 123)?
        .poll_blocking(Duration::from_secs(5))?;

    let message = "Hello, Aeron!".as_bytes();
    // if <0 its an error
    let result = publisher.offer(message, Handlers::no_reserved_value_supplier_handler());

    let closure =
        AeronFragmentHandlerClosure::from(move |msg: Vec<u8>, header: AeronHeader| {
            println!(
                "received a message from aeron {:?}, msg length:{}",
                header.position(),
                msg.len()
            );
        });
    let closure = Handler::leak_with_fragment_assembler(closure)?;

    loop {
        subscription.poll(Some(&closure), 128)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```
