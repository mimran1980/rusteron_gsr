## Project Overview

This project builds on a fork of [`libaeron-sys`](https://github.com/bspeice/libaeron-sys), offering Rust access to Aeron’s native C API. The API is **not fully idiomatic**, but is auto-generated for consistency and reliability. This tradeoff supports:

* Performance-sensitive trading environments
* Minimal runtime overhead
* Low maintenance costs

**Warning**: This library operates in an `unsafe` context and requires care. Improper usage (e.g., using a publisher after the Aeron client is closed) can lead to **undefined behavior or segmentation faults**.

## Installation

Choose the module and linking style appropriate for your project.

**Dynamic library:**

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = "0.2"
```

**Static library:**

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = { version = "0.2", features = ["static"] }
```

**Precompiled static libs (macOS and Linux, no cmake or Java needed):**

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = { version = "0.2", features = ["static", "precompile"] }
```

**Precompiled static libs with rustls downloader (macOS and Linux):**

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = { version = "0.2", features = ["static", "precompile-rustls"] }
```

Replace `rusteron-client` with `rusteron-archive` or `rusteron-media-driver` as needed.

For full build instructions, see [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md).

### CPU target

A release build from source compiles the Aeron C code for the build machine's CPU
(`-march=native`). Set `RUSTERON_C_MARCH` (e.g. `x86-64-v3`) when binaries run on
machines other than the one that built them. The precompiled libraries (`precompile`)
target the architecture's baseline (`x86-64`, `armv8-a`), so they run on any CPU.

### Multi-threaded (`Sync`) handles

Publication, subscription, counter and counters-reader handles are `Send` but **not `Sync`**
by default; they use `Rc` and may be moved to one owning thread. The `Aeron` client and
`AeronExclusivePublication` become `Send` only under `multi-threaded`; other handles
(contexts, images) stay on the thread that created them. Enable `multi-threaded` to swap `Rc` → `Arc` and add `unsafe impl Sync`,
so `&Handle` can be shared across threads for the ops Aeron C documents as thread-safe
(`offer` / `try_claim` / `position` / `is_connected`):

```toml
[dependencies]
rusteron-client = { version = "0.2", features = ["multi-threaded"] }
```

```rust,ignore
// AeronPublication is Sync under `multi-threaded`, so threads share `&publication`.
std::thread::scope(|s| -> Result<(), AeronOfferError> {
    let a = s.spawn(|| publication.offer(b"hello"));
    let b = s.spawn(|| publication.offer(b"world"));
    a.join().expect("publisher thread panicked")?;
    b.join().expect("publisher thread panicked")?;
    Ok(())
})?;
```

> **The flag only lifts the Rust-side barrier — it does not make the underlying Aeron
> object thread-safe.** Sharing is correct only for objects Aeron C documents as
> thread-safe for concurrent use, e.g. `AeronPublication` (`ConcurrentPublication`),
> `AeronCounter`, and `Aeron` itself. `AeronSubscription` is documented by Aeron as
> **not** threadsafe and must not be shared between subscribers — it stays `Send`-only
> (never `Sync`) even under `multi-threaded`, so it can be moved to one other thread but
> never accessed concurrently from several. `AeronExclusivePublication` is
> single-producer by design and must not be shared across threads either (it only gains
> `Send` under `multi-threaded`, never `Sync`). It is the caller's responsibility to
> check the thread-safety of each object before sharing `&Handle`.

    let driver = EmbeddedDriver::launch()?;

    let ctx = AeronContext::new()?;
    ctx.set_dir(&cformat!("{}", driver.dir()))?;
    // Error handler is Option (None = silently drop async client errors).

### C strings without hidden allocations

Every channel/URI argument is a `&CStr` (the C API's type), so every heap allocation is
visible at the call site. Recommended three-tier pattern, cheapest first:

```rust,ignore
// 1. Constant channels: c"..." literals — compile-time &'static CStr, zero runtime cost.
aeron.async_add_publication(c"aeron:ipc", 10)?;

// 2. Dynamic URIs: cformat! — ONE named heap allocation (format + CString in one step).
let uri = cformat!("aeron:udp?endpoint=localhost:{port}");
aeron.async_add_publication(&uri, 10)?;

// 3. Repeated paths: build the CString once, store it, pass `&it` (zero-copy on reuse).
let chan: std::ffi::CString = cformat!("aeron:udp?endpoint={endpoint}");
for _ in 0..reconnect_attempts {
    aeron.async_add_publication(&chan, 10)?; // no allocation per call
}
```

## What's new in 0.2

0.2 is a breaking release (deeper write-up in the [rusteron-client README](./rusteron-client/README.md#general-patterns)):

- **Deferred close.** `aeron.close()` no longer frees child resources immediately (the 0.1.x behaviour was a use-after-free). Close is deferred until the last reference drops; drop order is arbitrary. `unsafe close_now()` forces immediate teardown.
- **Reference-counted handlers.** `Handler::leak()`/`release()` are gone; `Handler::new()` is `Arc`-backed and freed when the last clone drops. Retained-callback setters take the value (closure or trait impl) and return the `Handler`. `Handlers::NONE` covers "no callback".
- **Typed errors.** `offer`/`try_claim` return `Result<i64, AeronOfferError>` with `is_retryable()`. `AeronCError` construction is allocation-free (never reads `aeron_errmsg()`); `capture_errmsg()` opts into attaching the message. Archive control ops return `Result<_, AeronArchiveError>` (`From` keeps `?` working).
- **Hot path.** `offer_parts(&[&header, &payload])` publishes several buffers as one message with no intermediate Vec; C-string args follow the `c""`/`cformat!`/reuse pattern above.
- **Convenience.** `Aeron::connect_dir`, `AeronDriver::launch_embedded_guard` (RAII), `ChannelUri::add_session_id`, `AeronUriStringBuilder::ipc()/udp()`, retained-image accessors, direct constant getters, and ported samples (basic_publisher/subscriber, ping/pong, file transfer, MDS, request/response).

## Migrating from 0.1.168 to 0.2

Old → new for every renamed/changed API

| 0.1.168 | 0.2 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Handler::leak(h)` + manual `handler.release()` | `Handler::new(h)` | Freed automatically when the last clone drops; registering resources keep clones. |
| `ctx.set_error_handler(Some(&handler))` (borrowed) | `ctx.set_error_handler(Some(handler_or_closure))` | Retained setters take the value; closures work directly; returns the `Handler`. |
| `aeron.close()` — freed children immediately | deferred close | Frees when the last reference drops; `unsafe close_now()` forces immediate. |
| `Handler` was `Sync` | `Send` only | The conductor thread invokes callbacks; sharing `&Handler` across threads raced. |
| `AeronPublication` / `AeronSubscription` / … were `Sync` | `Send` only by default; `Sync` only under `multi-threaded`, and only for types Aeron C documents as thread-safe | Handles use `Rc` (single-thread ownership). Enable the `multi-threaded` feature (`Rc` → `Arc`) to get `unsafe impl Sync` for `AeronPublication`/`AeronCounter`/`Aeron` (share `&Handle` across threads for `offer` / `try_claim` / `position` / `is_connected`). `AeronSubscription` and `AeronExclusivePublication` are documented by Aeron as not safe to share and remain `Send`-only (never `Sync`), even with `multi-threaded`. |
| `publication.offer(buf, supplier)` → raw `i64` | `publication.offer_raw(buf, supplier)` | Same branch-free sentinel return, renamed to make "raw" explicit. |
| `publication.offer_result(buf, supplier)` → `Result<_, AeronCError>` | `publication.offer_with_reserved_value(buf, supplier)` → `Result<_, AeronOfferError>` | Typed offer errors with `is_retryable()`. |
| `publication.offer_result_simple(buf)` | `publication.offer(buf)` | The common no-supplier case is now the flagship name. |
| `try_claim_result(len, claim)` / `try_claim_owned` → `AeronCError` | `try_claim(len, claim)` / `try_claim_owned` → `AeronOfferError` | Same RAII `AeronClaim`; typed error. |
| `subscription.poll_once(f, limit)` | `subscription.poll_fn(f, limit)` | Renamed (`_once` read as "one fragment"); same on `AeronImage` / `AeronArchiveReplayMerge`. |
| `subscription.for_each_fragment(limit, f)` | `subscription.poll_fn(f, limit)` | Removed (alias with the arguments in the opposite order). |
| `sub.poll(assembler.process(&mut ctx, f), limit)` | `assembler.poll(&sub, &mut ctx, f, limit)` | `process()` leaked a raw ctx pointer past the borrow (UAF hazard); the new form scopes it. |
| `Handlers::no_available_image_handler()`, `no_unavailable_image_handler()`, … | `Handlers::NONE` | One constant, any callback parameter, full inference. Old helpers removed. |
| `pub.add_destination(&aeron, dest, timeout)` (`&mut self`) | `pub.add_destination(dest, timeout)` (`&self`) | Owning `Aeron` comes from the handle's dependency graph. Same for subscriptions / exclusive publications. |
| `AeronCnc::new(dir)` | `AeronCnc::open(&CStr)` or `AeronCnc::read(&CStr, \|cnc\| { … })` | `new_on_heap`/`read_on_partial_stack` renamed; now accept `&CStr` (not `&str`/`&CString`). `read` = scoped (zero-alloc, preferred for one-shot), `open` = owned handle (for repeated polling). |
| `&"aeron:ipc".into_c_string()` (allocates at runtime) | `c"aeron:ipc"` | See "C strings without hidden allocations" above; `cformat!` for dynamic URIs. |
| `wrapper.get_inner_mut()` / `ManagedCResource::get_mut()` (safe) | `unsafe …()` | `&mut` from `&self`; the caller must now promise exclusive access. The only internal caller (`clone_struct`) is wrapped in `unsafe` already. |
| `AeronUriStringBuilder::put_string(&CStr, &str)` / `put_strings(&str, &str)` | `AeronUriStringBuilder::put_str(&CStr, &str)` | Single name, single key type (`&CStr` — pair with `c"media"` or `CStr::from_bytes_until_nul`); `put_strings` removed (no external callers). |
| `archive.begin_replay(...)`, `start_recording(...)`, … → `Result<_, AeronCError>` | `Result<_, AeronArchiveError>` | Control ops on `AeronArchive` return the typed error (parseable code + message). Constructors, async-connect, and context setters still return `AeronCError`; `From<AeronArchiveError> for AeronCError` keeps `?` working across the boundary. |
| `async_add_exclusive_publication.poll(...).get_registration_id()` on the deprecated `exclusive_exclusive` alias | only `aeron_async_add_exclusive_publication_get_registration_id` is exposed | The deprecated `aeron_async_add_exclusive_exclusive_publication_get_registration_id` C alias is dropped (it collided with the canonical name); use the canonical `get_registration_id()`. |
| `DarwinPthread*`, `OpaquePthread*` wrapper structs in the generated API | removed | Bindgen pthread internals are no longer emitted as wrapper types; socket types the driver wrappers reference (`sockaddr_storage`, `iovec`, …) are retained. |

Behavioural notes:
- A panicking fragment handler aborts the process (panic cannot unwind across the C
  callback boundary) — return instead of panicking in handlers.
- `AeronCError` construction never reads or copies `aeron_errmsg()` — retry loops
  (e.g. polling that keeps returning `-1`) stay allocation-free. `Display` /
  `get_last_err_message()` read the live buffer; call `err.capture_errmsg()` at the
  error site to pin the text to the error when you store it or log it later.

For recording, replay, and **persistent subscriptions** (replay history, then seamlessly join a
live stream), see [`rusteron-archive`](./rusteron-archive/README.md#persistent-subscriptions).
