// dedicated publisher/subscriber thread) and use it exclusively there; `Send` is
// retained unconditionally to allow that one-time hand-off even without the
// `multi-threaded` feature.
//
// `Send` over a plain `Rc` is technically unsound in the general case (cloning the
// handle and using clones from two different threads concurrently races the
// non-atomic refcount) — this is a deliberate, documented "accepted unsoundness"
// trade-off for latency: callers must not clone these handles across threads or use
// one handle from multiple threads concurrently unless `multi-threaded` (below,
// atomic `Arc`) is enabled.
//
// `Sync` is intentionally NOT implemented by default: sharing `&Handle` across
// threads would let two threads `Rc::clone` concurrently and race the refcount.

// `UnsafeCell` fields inside `ManagedCResource` are mutated only during construction
// and close, never during the shared-read window.

// `AeronSubscription` deliberately has no `Sync` impl, with or without
