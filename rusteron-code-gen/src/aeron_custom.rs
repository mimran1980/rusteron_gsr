// These handle types wrap `Rc` (via `CResource::OwnedOnHeap`), so in principle
// they are `!Send + !Sync`. We deliberately keep `Rc` (non-atomic refcount) for
// latency — `Arc` is banned in this library. The idiomatic Aeron usage is to
// MOVE a handle to a single owning thread and use it exclusively there, never
// sharing `&Handle` across threads, so we retain `Send` to support that pattern.
//
// `Sync` is intentionally NOT implemented: sharing `&Handle` across threads
// would let two threads `Rc::clone` the inner `Rc` concurrently → refcount data
// race → UB. Nothing in this codebase shares `&Handle` across threads.
//
// Retaining `Send` over `Rc` is technically unsound (a non-atomic refcount
// touched from >1 thread races), but per project policy "rather be unsound than
// slow" this is documented and accepted. Do NOT clone these handles across
// threads; do NOT use one handle from multiple threads concurrently.
